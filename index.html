            <p>Hello! My name is Sarah Diaz Pereira and I am from Valinhos, Brazil.
            I enjoy travel, read books, watch tv shows, play video games, make up and beauty products;
            I love to learn new things, specially new languagues. I already speak English and Spanish;
            I am looking forward to learn French, Italian and German. I also have a bachelor degree in Business
            and a Postgraduated degree in Management and Planning. I've always dreamed of working in the technology field,
            and I believe this course will open many doors. I'm loving everything I'm learning, and I'm very happy to see my progress 
            with HTML. It has been rewarding to see the results on my page each week!</p>
